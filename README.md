run_analysis.R
=======================

This is a repository for Cousera's Getting and Cleaning Data peer assessment project. The main purpose of this repository is to provide a script (run_analysis.R) that manipulates the [Human Activity Recognition using smartphones data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) by executing the following transformations:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
