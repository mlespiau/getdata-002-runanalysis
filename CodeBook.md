The foundations of this data set are the test and training data provided by the [Human Activity Recognition using smartphones data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Note: For the purpose of this analysis we did not considered the inertial signals measurements provided in the homonimous folder, only the following files were taken into account for building this data set: train/X_train.txt, train/y_train.txt, train/subject_train.txt, test/X_test.txt, test/y_test.txt and test/subject_test.txt.
